title: Failure
---

## Departure from expectations
## When we see a program produce an outcome that's not expected
## For failure to be observed, four conditions must be satisfied:
### **Reachability**: location or locations in program that contain fault must be reached
:PROPERTIES:
:id: 605970e4-d621-42ef-a0cb-49b496f01c4a
:END:
### **Infection**: must create an incorrect [[Program State]]
:PROPERTIES:
:id: 605970e4-777b-4ea7-8bc6-9c6faeb08039
:END:
### **Propagation**: infected [[Program State]] must cause final [[Program State]] to be incorrect
### **Revealability**: incorrect portion of final [[Program State]] must be observed from the outside
