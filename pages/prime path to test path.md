title: Prime path to Test path
---

## 1. Choose the longest prime path and extend it so it starts at a start state of a graph and ends at an end state of a graph.
### **This constructs a test path**
## 2. Once you have the a list the Test path, go back to list of prime paths and cross out the prime paths that appear inside any test paths
## 3. Again, choose the longest prime path that's note crossed out and extend it (start over at step 1)
