title: Computing prime paths

## Find all [[Simple path]]s:
### Meaning find all [[Simple path]]s of length $0$ and extend them to length $1$, then length $2$, and so on.
### Select those that are maximal
## `*` indicates a cycle and it cannot be extended for the next step.
## `!` in a path table means to not consider that node because it doesn't have outgoing edges.
## **CAREFUL:** any path with `*` is a [[Prime path]]
