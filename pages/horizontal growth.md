## Start by adding all the input values available for the new parameter without repeating any; Just listing them down the column
## After, if there is a value left to place to complete the column do a [[Tie Breaker]] to decide which value should go next
### When you've decided which value goes next, cross out the now covered elements in the respective parameter sets
## **Repeat this until column is complete**
## **NOTE:** this step does not add tests
